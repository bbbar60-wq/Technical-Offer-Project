Technical Offer Automation UI
A modern, responsive, and feature-rich front-end interface for managing the creation and revision of technical sales offers.

A preview of the project workspace in dark mode.

üìñ Description
This application provides a user-friendly interface for sales engineers and managers to streamline the process of building complex technical proposals. It allows users to manage a catalog of products and clients, create new projects, add equipment with specific quantities and deviations, and track the history of an offer through a revision system.

The entire front end is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a mocked API that uses browser localStorage to persist data, allowing for a full-featured demonstration without a live backend.

‚ú® Features
Authentication: Secure login/logout flow with client-side session management.

Dashboard: A central hub to access key modules of the application.

CRUD Operations: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for Products and Clients.

Project Management: Create projects, link them to clients, and manage associated documents (simulated).

Revision Control: Robust "Rev Up" system to create versioned copies of a technical offer, preserving history.

Dynamic Equipment Selection: A powerful modal to search, filter, and add multiple products to a project revision.

Deviation Management: Add and track client-specific deviations for any piece of equipment in an offer.

Asynchronous Job Simulation: User-friendly toast notifications to provide feedback for long-running tasks like document generation.

Theming: A beautiful and persistent light/dark mode theme switcher for user comfort.

Responsive Design: A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
